TrollUniversity
===============

The Troll University is a movement that Matt Costi and I are founding. Students enrolled will be provided training in troll theory, practice and ethics. There is no tuition. Support will be provided for trolls in the form of multiple web apps contained in this repository.

App is now running live at http://troll-university.appspot.com/
